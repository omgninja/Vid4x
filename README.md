# INTRODUCTION
Public-viable image super-resolution service was made available by Waifu2X, a free-to-use web-based image super-resolution service. However, super-resolution services for video are only available via commercial product, for instance, Insta4K produce by Red Giant . 
This project aims to develop a public-viable web-based video super-resolution solution using computer vision and machine learning technology. The software will be relatively light-weighted to ensure ease of deployment.
The project will deliver a video-upscaling service with a fully functional web interface.

Features are as follow:

* Functional features:
  * Web-based uploading portal for user to upload video
  * Super-resolution up to 4x
  * A list of processed video for user to download

* Non-functional features:
  * Responsive web design
  * NoSQL database
